## Data

This project explores the use of machine learning to model expected goals (xG) in hockey, helping evaluate shot quality based on location, situation, and player context. Using a curated dataset of historical NHL shot data, the notebook builds a predictive xG model and visualizes key insights to enhance understanding of scoring probabilities in different game scenarios.

The shot data is from 2015-2023 (regular seasons only).
